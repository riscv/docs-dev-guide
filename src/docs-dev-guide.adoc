:revremark: Pre-release version
//development: assume everything can change
//stable: assume everything could change
//frozen: of you implement this version you assume the risk that something might change because of the public review cycle  but we expect little to no change.
//ratified: you can implement this and be assured nothing will change. if something needs to change due to an errata or enhancement, it will come out in a new extension. we do not revise extensions.

//the colophon allows for a section after the preamble that is part of the frontmatter and therefore not assigned a page number.
